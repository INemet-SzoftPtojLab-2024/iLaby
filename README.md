Tell your team every time a pull request has been merged with master. Don’t let your team members fall behind master.
Pull often, just to be sure. Even if no one has told you about changes on master, pull anyways. It doesn’t hurt.
Under Branches on GitHub you can find a visual representation of how far behind or head your branch is from master.
Double check with team members before merging.
Make sure you are on a branch before you start working. Get in the habit of checking.
